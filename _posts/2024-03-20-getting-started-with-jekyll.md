# Getting Started with Jekyll

## Introduction

Jekyll is a powerful static site generator that's perfect for creating blogs and documentation sites. In this guide, we'll explore how to set up and customize your Jekyll site.

## Prerequisites

Before we begin, make sure you have the following installed:
- Ruby (version 2.5.0 or higher)
- RubyGems
- Node.js and npm
- Git

## Setting Up Your First Jekyll Site

1. **Install Jekyll and Bundler**
   ```bash
   gem install jekyll bundler
   ```

2. **Create a New Jekyll Site**
   ```bash
   jekyll new my-blog
   cd my-blog
   ```

3. **Start the Local Server**
   ```bash
   bundle exec jekyll serve
   ```

## Customizing Your Site

### Configuration

The `_config.yml` file is the heart of your Jekyll site. Here's a basic configuration:

```yaml
title: My Awesome Blog
description: A blog about technology and programming
baseurl: ""
url: ""

# Build settings
markdown: kramdown
plugins:
  - jekyll-feed
  - jekyll-seo-tag
```

### Creating Posts

Posts are stored in the `_posts` directory. Name your files using the format:
```
YYYY-MM-DD-title.md
```

### Front Matter

Every post should include front matter at the top:

```yaml
---
layout: post
title: "Your Post Title"
date: YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM:SS +/-TTTT
categories: [Category1, Category2]
tags: [tag1, tag2]
---
```

## Best Practices

1. **Organization**
   - Keep your posts organized in categories
   - Use meaningful tags
   - Maintain a consistent naming convention

2. **Content**
   - Write clear, concise posts
   - Include code examples when relevant
   - Use images to enhance your content

3. **Performance**
   - Optimize images
   - Minimize external dependencies
   - Use caching when possible

## Conclusion

Jekyll is a powerful tool for creating static websites. With its simple setup and extensive customization options, it's perfect for blogs and documentation sites.
