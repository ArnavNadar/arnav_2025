**About Me**

I’m a high school junior who sees computer science not just as a subject, but as a toolkit for solving unexpected problems—whether it’s simplifying crypto investing for teens, building AI that suggests gifts, or designing interactive lessons that teach themselves. I’m especially drawn to full stack development and the magic of turning ideas into tools people actually use.

I’ve built projects using Java, Python, SQLite, APIs, and modern frontend frameworks, often mixing creative design with solid engineering. I love finding the relationship between code and real life. This could be involving education, finance, or just something that makes someone say “Whoa, that’s cool.”



**Project Overview**
*Open Coding Society*
Crypto Mining


Crypto Mining is part of Gamify, Open Coding Society’s game to help students practice their use of money so that they are ready for the real world. Crypto Mining allows students to get practice with mining different crypto currencies (Bitcoin, Ethereum, Litecoin, Monero). You have opportunities to buy and use different GPU's and the more expensive the GPU, the more value you get out of it. Even though this is a game we've made it as realistic as possible in relation to the real world.

**Unique Qualities (NFT's)**

- Made crypto mining as realistic as possible to the real world (energy store, variety of GPU's, different crypto currencies, and etc)
- You can use the money you make on crypto mining with other features like the Casino (Blackjack, poker, and etc)

**Project Showcase**

[N@TM](https://github.com/ArnavNadar/arnav_2025/issues/19)

Night at the Museum was an amazing opportunity for me to showcase my feature to the more people. I enjoyed being able to show off my knowledge and features on how my group and I made out crypto mining simulator. We got lots of feedback and also noticed some bugs and that is all a good thing so that we can improve! This feedback was highly valuable.
