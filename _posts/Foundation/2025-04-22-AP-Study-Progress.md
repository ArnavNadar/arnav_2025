# AP CSA Study Progress Update

## Video Course Completion
Studying through AP videos has been an essential part of my learning journey. The structured approach and clear explanations have helped me understand concepts in CollegeBoard terms, making it easier to connect classroom learning with exam requirements.

### Progress Tracking
- [x] Unit 1: Primitive Types
- [x] Unit 2: Using Objects
- [x] Unit 3: Boolean Expressions and if Statements
- [x] Unit 4: Iteration
- [x] Unit 5: Writing Classes
- [ ] Unit 6: Array
- [ ] Unit 7: ArrayList
- [ ] Unit 8: 2D Array
- [ ] Unit 9: Inheritance
- [ ] Unit 10: Recursion

## MCQ Review Completion
Multiple choice questions have proven to be more challenging than FRQs in my experience. To strengthen this area, I'm planning to:

1. Review all previous practice exams
2. Focus on understanding common patterns in MCQ questions
3. Practice time management for the MCQ section
4. Identify and work on specific topics where I struggle



## Additional Resources

### FRQ Practice By Topic

This resource has been invaluable for targeted practice. It allows me to:
- Focus on specific topics I need to improve
- Understand the different types of FRQ questions
- Practice with real exam questions
- Track my progress across different question types

### Video Tutorials

These video tutorials have significantly enhanced my learning process by:
- Providing clear explanations of complex topics
- Offering multiple perspectives on problem-solving
- Including practical examples and demonstrations
- Breaking down concepts into manageable chunks

## Next Steps
1. Complete remaining video course units
2. Schedule regular MCQ practice sessions
3. Focus on FRQ practice by topic
4. Review and reinforce weak areas
5. Take full-length practice exams under timed conditions

I'll continue to update this post as I make progress in my AP CSA preparation journey.
