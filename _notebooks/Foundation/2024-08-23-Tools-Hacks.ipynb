    "## Tools Verification Hacks \n",
    "\n",
    "**Objective**: Verify that the tools installed are working correctly, and each student can demonstrate an understanding of basic usage.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Verify Installation\n",
    "It is important that you resolve tool issues immediately. These are the foundations for 24 weeks for CSSE and 36 weeks for CSP and CSA.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Check Tool Functionality**: Ensure the tools installed in Tools Setup are working correctly using the provided scripts and outputs.\n",
    "- **Run Basic Commands**: Execute basic commands for each tool from the terminal (e.g., `git --version`, `ruby --version`, `python --version`, etc.).\n",
    "- **Document Issues and Resolutions**: Record any issues encountered and the strategies and verifications you performed to resolve them.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Prepare for Pair Showcase (Tool Verification)\n",
    "Develop a student view to verify tool installation with the Teacher. You and your pair should share the same validation procedures, but each individual needs to show those procedures running on their personal hardware environment.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Verification Discussion**: Be prepared to discuss outputs from shell scripts during verification.\n",
    "- **Comment Code Cells**: Add comments to code cells to remember and discuss how these verifications work.\n",
    "- **Live Reviews**: Live reviews are subject to Teacher opinion unless you show indisputable command through vocabulary and technical accuracy.\n",
    "\n",
    "### GitHub Usage with VSCode\n",
    "During the tools and installation process, you are expected to become familiar with VSCode to GitHub operations. By the end of this project, it is expected that you will have a minimum of 5 significant commits.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Perform Basic Operations with GitHub Integration in VSCode\n",
    "Use GitHub with VSCode frequently. Lots of small, iterative commits are recommended.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Commit**: Save changes to your local repository.\n",
    "- **VSCode Sync (Push)**: Upload your local commits to the remote repository on GitHub.\n",
    "- **Pull**: Download changes from the remote repository to your local repository.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Prepare for Pair Showcase (GitHub)\n",
    "Prepare a 1-minute summary on GitHub Usage. This should focus on GitLens VSCode extension and an interactive overview of the pair's history.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Show Commits**: Display the history of changes made to the repository using GitLens->Commits.\n",
    "- **Show Contributors**: Highlight the individuals who have contributed to the repository using GitLens->Contributors.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Brief Definitions\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Git**: A distributed version control system that allows multiple developers to work on a project simultaneously without overwriting each other's changes.\n",
    "- **GitLens**: An extension for VSCode that gives insights into Git repositories. It helps visualize code authorship, track changes, and understand the history and evolution of a codebase.\n",
    "\n",
    "By completing these tasks, you will ensure that your development environment is correctly set up and that you are proficient in using essential tools and GitHub integration."

    "## Tool Play with JavaScript\n",
    "\n",
    "**Objective**: Use your tools installation to learn JavaScript, create dynamic web content, and understand that there are many ways to solve the same problem (coding styles).\n",
    "\n",
    "### JavaScript Ideation\n",
    "\n",
    "Using ideas and hints from the Tool Play lesson, start the ideation process in Jupyter Notebooks to define your future `index.md` home page.\n",
    "\n",
    "Ideation in the course starts in Jupyter Notebooks. Follow these steps:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Create an HTML File**: Start with an HTML file that includes a container element.\n",
    "2. **Enhance with CSS**: Use CSS to style your HTML elements.\n",
    "3. **Modify with JavaScript**: Use JavaScript to dynamically modify content within the HTML container.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Vocabulary Note**: Modifying an HTML container is often referred to as modifying the DOM (Document Object Model). The term \"DOM\" will be used frequently in the course and is associated with the \"document.\" prefix used in commands like `document.createElement`.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Update `index.md` Home Page\n",
    "\n",
    "Transition from ideation to designing your own home pages. As you work with your pair, you should learn similar coding styles, but your end product should be unique.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Integrate JavaScript**: Incorporate your JavaScript code into your GitHub Pages project.\n",
    "2. **Verify Display**: Ensure that the dynamic content is displayed correctly on both localhost and the deployed server.\n",
    "3. **Document Challenges**: Blog about any challenges faced and how you overcame them.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Prepare a 2-Minute Summary on Your `index.md`\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Demo the Pages**: Show the live pages on both localhost and the deployed server.\n",
    "2. **Show the Code**: Walk through the JavaScript code that modifies the DOM.\n",
    "3. **Jupyter Ideation Process**: Explain the ideation process documented in your Jupyter Notebooks.\n",
    "4. **Coding Style Question**: Be prepared to answer the question, \"How could you use another coding style to change your loop?\" For example, if you used a `for` loop, explain how you could use `forEach` or another iteration method.\n",
    "\n",
    "By completing these \"Hacks,\" you will gain a deeper understanding of the tools and processes involved in setting up and managing a development environment, verifying tool installations, and applying JavaScript to create dynamic web content.\n",

    "## Computers and Terminals\n",
    "\n",
    "Understanding Terminal and Linux is key to mastering Linux. When a computer boots up, the **kernel (MacOS, Windows, or Linux)**, which is the core of the operating system, starts and manages hardware resources. Above the kernel, applications like the **shell** and **terminal** allow users to interact with the system using basic commands.\n",
    "\n",
    "Most users use a Desktop User Interface (UI) launched during boot-up. For direct shell interaction, a \"terminal\" application can be run through the Desktop UI. **VS Code** also offers an integrated \"terminal\" for running commands within the code editor.\n",
    "\n",
    "Next, we'll use a Jupyter notebook to run Linux commands in a terminal. Jupyter provides an interactive environment on top of the kernel, combining code execution, data analysis, and documentation to enhance productivity and learning.\n",

    "\n",
    "You will be making a personal copy of the course repository. Be sure to have a GitHub account!!!\n",
    "\n",
    "- Use the **Green \"Use this Template\"** button on the [portfolio_2025](https://github.com/nighthawkcoders/portfolio_2025) repository page to set up your personal GitHub Pages repository.\n",

    "\n",
    "In the next few code cells, we will run a bash (shell) script to pull a GitHub project. \n",
    "\n",
    "## Shell Script and Variables\n",
    "\n",
    "We will ultimately run a bash (shell) script to pull a GitHub project. This next script simply sets up the necessary **environment variables** to tell the script the location of repository from GitHub and where to copy the output.\n",
    "\n",
    "For now, focus on each line that begins with `export`. These are **shell variables**. Each line has a **name** (after the keyword `export`) and a **value** (after the equal sign).\n",
    "\n",
    "Here is a full description:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Creates a temporary file** `/tmp/variables.sh` to store environment variables.\n",
    "- **Sets the `project_dir` variable** to your home directory with a subdirectory named `nighthawk`. You can change `nighthawk` to a different name to test your git clone.\n",
    "- **Sets the `project` variable** to a subdirectory within `project_dir` named `portfolio_2025`. You can change `portfolio_2025` to the name of your project.\n",
    "- **Sets the `project_repo` variable** to the URL of the GitHub repository. Change this to the project you created from the `portfolio_2025` template.\n",
    "\n",
    "**By running this script, you will prepare your environment for cloning** and working on your GitHub project. This is an essential step in setting up your development environment and ensuring that all dependencies are correctly configured.\n",

    "```bash\n",
    "\n",
    "## Describing the Outputs of the Variables\n",
    "\n",
    "The next script will extract the saved variables and display their values. Here is a description of the commands:\n",
    "\n",
    "- The `source` command loads the variables that we saved in the `/tmp/variables.sh` file in the previous code cell.\n",
    "- The `echo` commands display the contents of the named variables:\n",
    "  - **project_dir**: The directory where your project is located.\n",
    "  - **project**: The specific project directory within `project_dir`.\n",
    "  - **project_repo**: The URL of the GitHub repository.\n",
    "\n",
    "By running this script, you can verify that the environment variables are correctly set in your development environment. If they don't match up, go back to the previous code cell and make the necessary corrections.\n",

    "## Project Setup and Analysis with Bash Scripts\n",
    "The bash scripts that follow automate what was done in the Tools Installation procedures with regards to cloning a GitHub project. Doing this in a script fashion adds the following benefits:\n",
    "\n",
    "- After completing these steps, we will have notes on how to set up and verify a project.\n",
    "- By reviewing these commands, you will start to learn the basics of Linux.\n",
    "- By setting up these code cells, you will be learning how to develop automated scripts using Shell programming.\n",

There is conditional logic to make sure that the clone only happens if it does not (!) exist. Here are some key elements in this code:\n",
    "\n",
    "- `cd` command (change directory), remember this from the terminal session.\n",
    "- `if` statements (conditional statements, called selection statements by College Board), code inside only happens if the condition is met.\n",
