       "\n",
       "Between the cash pouring into athletic programs via collectives ‚Äî a fancy name for boosters who funnel much of the N.I.L. money to players ‚Äî and more lenient transfer rules, a sort of eBay to buy athletes has been created, transforming how powerhouse teams are built.\n",
       "\n",
       "‚ÄúIt‚Äôs whoever wants to pay, the most money raised, the most money to buy the most players, is going to have the best opportunity to win,‚Äù Nick Saban, the recently retired football coach at the University of Alabama, told Congress in March.\n",
       "\n",
       "But how do athletes, coaches and administrators determine the going rates? Many consult the Black Book, a kind of Zillow for college sports, which details an athlete‚Äôs expected annual earnings, and, in the case of sports like football and men‚Äôs and women‚Äôs basketball, even breaking them down by position and conference.\n",
       "\n",
       "$1.7 billion market $1.7 billion market 80% collectives $1.7 billion market 30% disclosed A series of three proportional area charts related to the N.I.L market. The first square shows the overall size of the N.I.L. market, the second shows that 80 percent of the market is made up by donor groups known as collectives and the third shows that only 30 percent of the market is publicly disclosed. Opendorse, the company behind the Black Book, projects around $1.7 billion in transactions in the N.I.L. market this year. Of that, 80 percent will come through collectives like Texas‚Äô Team One Foundation and the Classic City Collective at the University of Georgia. But even that is an incomplete picture of a rapidly changing N.I.L. frontier awash with money. There is no universal requirement for athletes to disclose how much they are being paid. Less than a third of the money that student athletes are making is publicly known, according to Opendorse.\n",
       "\n",
       "Still, the Black Book is a must have for university collectives and collegiate athletic officials, as well as the lawyers involved in House v. N.C.A.A., an antitrust case in which the Black Book and all Opendorse data from 2016 through 2022 were subpoenaed. The sides recently agreed to a $2.8 billion settlement.\n",
       "\n",
       "If a federal judge approves it, schools will be allowed to set aside around $20 million per year, beginning in the fall of 2025, to pay athletes. (The proposal also calls for a program by which athletes‚Äô N.I.L. deals could be reviewed.)\n",
       "\n",
       "The Black Book, copies of which were obtained by The New York Times, shows that, even as football remains the dominant sport financially, sports like women‚Äôs basketball have become increasingly lucrative. In her final season at the University of Iowa, Caitlin Clark sold out arenas, increased television ratings and had sponsorship deals valued at $3 million.\n",
       "\n",
       "Clark may have been the sport‚Äôs unicorn, but title-contending programs are expected to spend more than $730,000 on their starting five, with guards being the most valued at $225,000.\n",
       "\n",
       "The N.I.L. era has also created a new generation of entrepreneurs and given them a more concrete sense of their earning potential. For instance, Alex Glover, a star volleyball player who recently concluded her career at Southern Methodist University, made more than $100,000 from sponsors who wanted to be associated with her Instagram video series, called ‚ÄúDay-In-The-Life of a D1 Volleyballer.‚Äù\n",

They don‚Äôt want to get paid just for going to practice and games.‚Äù\n",

       "Lawrence, a former starting linebacker at the University of Nebraska, began Opendorse in 2012 to help his former teammate Prince Amukamara monetize his brand after he entered the N.F.L. as a first-round draft pick with the New York Giants. Lawrence understood the commitment required of college athletes and anticipated that the pay-to-play model was coming sooner rather than later. More than a decade on, some 150,000 athletes have used his platform to grow their name, image and likeness revenues.\n",

       "‚ÄúI know what it takes to be an athlete and wanted to create something like Expedia or Zillow that took the mystery out of getting good value and putting that power in the hands of athletes,‚Äù said Lawrence, who offers tutorials on topics like marketing and pay benchmarks on his Instagram feed. ‚ÄúThis is all new to them.

       "The expected annual N.I.L. compensation for a top-10-earning football player at any position is $216,000 for the Big Ten and $565,000 in the SEC, which is more than three times the annual earnings of $159,000 in the Big 12.\n",
       "\n",
       "The SEC‚Äôs stature is even more pronounced this year. The former Big 12 powerhouses Texas and Oklahoma have joined the conference, which is made up of state universities that have long taken football seriously and invested heavily in athletics. The top-10-earning SEC players at every position ‚Äî except for tight ends and specialists ‚Äî earn more annually on average than players in any other Power Four conference. A running back in the SEC can now expect to make about half a million dollars, almost as much as a Big 12 quarterback. Offensive and defensive linemen in the SEC do even better, tallying upward of $700,000.\n",
       "\n",
       "For the smaller, so-called Group of Five conferences, which include Conference USA and the Mountain West, the new N.I.L. environment puts football championships even further out of reach. The average value of top 25 players at any position at schools such as Liberty (part of Conference USA) or Boise State (in the Mountain West) is just under $50,000.\n",

       "\n",
       "Many star players like Bacot are now forgoing the ritual of leaving school after just a year or two to enter the N.B.A. Instead of jumping (ready or not) into the draft in search of riches, more players are choosing the ample N.I.L. pay and more time to work on their games and degrees.

       "Between the cash pouring into athletic programs via collectives ‚Äî a fancy name for boosters who funnel much of the N.I.L. money to players ‚Äî and more lenient transfer rules, a sort of eBay to buy athletes has been created, transforming how powerhouse teams are built.\n",
       "\n",
       "‚ÄúIt‚Äôs whoever wants to pay, the most money raised, the most money to buy the most players, is going to have the best opportunity to win,‚Äù Nick Saban, the recently retired football coach at the University of Alabama, told Congress in March.\n",
       "\n",
       "But how do athletes, coaches and administrators determine the going rates? Many consult the Black Book, a kind of Zillow for college sports, which details an athlete‚Äôs expected annual earnings, and, in the case of sports like football and men‚Äôs and women‚Äôs basketball, even breaking them down by position and conference.\n",

       "$1.7 billion market $1.7 billion market 80% collectives $1.7 billion market 30% disclosed A series of three proportional area charts related to the N.I.L market. The first square shows the overall size of the N.I.L. market, the second shows that 80 percent of the market is made up by donor groups known as collectives and the third shows that only 30 percent of the market is publicly disclosed. Opendorse, the company behind the Black Book, projects around $1.7 billion in transactions in the N.I.L. market this year. Of that, 80 percent will come through collectives like Texas‚Äô Team One Foundation and the Classic City Collective at the University of Georgia. But even that is an incomplete picture of a rapidly changing N.I.L. frontier awash with money. There is no universal requirement for athletes to disclose how much they are being paid. Less than a third of the money that student athletes are making is publicly known, according to Opendorse.\n",
       "\n",
       "Still, the Black Book is a must have for university collectives and collegiate athletic officials, as well as the lawyers involved in House v. N.C.A.A., an antitrust case in which the Black Book and all Opendorse data from 2016 through 2022 were subpoenaed. The sides recently agreed to a $2.8 billion settlement.\n",

       "If a federal judge approves it, schools will be allowed to set aside around $20 million per year, beginning in the fall of 2025, to pay athletes. (The proposal also calls for a program by which athletes‚Äô N.I.L. deals could be reviewed.)\n",
       "\n",
       "The Black Book, copies of which were obtained by The New York Times, shows that, even as football remains the dominant sport financially, sports like women‚Äôs basketball have become increasingly lucrative.

       "The N.I.L. era has also created a new generation of entrepreneurs and given them a more concrete sense of their earning potential.

       "\n",
       "The SEC‚Äôs stature is even more pronounced this year. The former Big 12 powerhouses Texas and Oklahoma have joined the conference, which is made up of state universities that have long taken football seriously and invested heavily in athletics. The top-10-earning SEC players at every position ‚Äî except for tight ends and specialists ‚Äî earn more annually on average than players in any other Power Four conference. A running back in the SEC can now expect to make about half a million dollars, almost as much as a Big 12 quarterback. Offensive and defensive linemen in the SEC do even better, tallying upward of $700,000.\n",
       "\n",
       "For the smaller, so-called Group of Five conferences, which include Conference USA and the Mountain West, the new N.I.L. environment puts football championships even further out of reach.

       "Many star players like Bacot are now forgoing the ritual of leaving school after just a year or two to enter the N.B.A. Instead of jumping (ready or not) into the draft in search of riches, more players are choosing the ample N.I.L. pay and more time to work on their games and degrees.
